                <h1>Feeding</h1>
                <p class="lede">Whether your baby is breastfed, bottle fed, or both, here's how you can be involved and support feeding.</p>

                <h2>Supporting Breastfeeding</h2>
                <p>Even if you're not the one feeding, you play a crucial role in making breastfeeding work.</p>

                <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bring water and snacks:</strong> Breastfeeding is thirsty and hungry work. Keep your partner hydrated and fed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Help with positioning:</strong> Arrange pillows, bring the baby, help get comfortable</li>
                    <li><strong>Take the baby after:</strong> Do the burping, changing, and settling so your partner can rest</li>
                    <li><strong>Be patient and supportive:</strong> Breastfeeding can be challenging. Your encouragement matters</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn the basics:</strong> Understand how breastfeeding works so you can help troubleshoot</li>
                    <li><strong>Handle night feeds:</strong> Bring the baby to your partner, then take them back for burping and settling</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Understanding Breastfeeding</h3>
                <p>Babies feed on demand, which means whenever they show hunger cues. In the early weeks, this can be very frequent - every 1-3 hours, including at night. This is normal and helps establish milk supply.</p>
                <p>Feeds can take 20-45 minutes. Let your baby finish on one side before offering the other. They'll come off when they're done.</p>

                <h2>Bottle Feeding</h2>
                <p>If you're bottle feeding (with formula or expressed breast milk), here's how to do it safely and effectively.</p>

                <h3>Holding Your Baby</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hold your baby in a semi-upright position</li>
                    <li>Support their head and neck</li>
                    <li>Make eye contact and talk to them</li>
                    <li>Never prop the bottle - always hold it</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Feeding Technique</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Test the temperature on your wrist - it should feel lukewarm, not hot</li>
                    <li>Touch the teat to your baby's lips to encourage them to open their mouth</li>
                    <li>Hold the bottle at an angle so the teat is full of milk (reduces air intake)</li>
                    <li>Let your baby control the pace - don't force the teat in</li>
                    <li>If they turn away or push the bottle out, they might be full or need a break</li>
                    <li>Never force them to finish a bottle</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>How Much to Feed</h3>
                <p>Newborns typically take 60-90ml (2-3oz) per feed, increasing to 120-180ml (4-6oz) by 2-3 months. But every baby is different. Feed on demand and let your baby guide you.</p>
                <p>Signs they've had enough:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turning away from the bottle</li>
                    <li>Pushing the bottle out</li>
                    <li>Closing their mouth</li>
                    <li>Falling asleep</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Preparing Formula</h2>
                <div class="warning-callout">
                    <h3>Important: Formula Safety</h3>
                    <p>Formula must be prepared correctly to be safe. Always follow the instructions on the tin and use freshly boiled water that has cooled for no more than 30 minutes.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Step-by-Step Formula Preparation</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash your hands thoroughly</li>
                    <li>Sterilise the bottle and teat (see Sterilising Equipment below)</li>
                    <li>Boil fresh tap water in a kettle</li>
                    <li>Let it cool for no more than 30 minutes (should still be at least 70°C)</li>
                    <li>Pour the correct amount of water into the sterilised bottle</li>
                    <li>Add the correct number of scoops (level, not heaped) using the scoop from the tin</li>
                    <li>Put the teat and cap on securely</li>
                    <li>Shake gently to mix</li>
                    <li>Test temperature on your wrist before feeding</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Preparing Expressed Breast Milk</h3>
                <p>If using expressed breast milk:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thaw frozen milk in the fridge overnight, or in a bowl of warm water</li>
                    <li>Never use a microwave to heat breast milk (it destroys nutrients and creates hot spots)</li>
                    <li>Gently swirl to mix (don't shake vigorously)</li>
                    <li>Use within 24 hours if stored in the fridge</li>
                    <li>Discard any milk left in the bottle after a feed</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Sterilising Equipment</h2>
                <p>All feeding equipment must be sterilised until your baby is 12 months old.</p>

                <h3>Methods of Sterilising</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Steam steriliser:</strong> Fast and effective. Follow manufacturer's instructions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> Submerge bottles and teats in boiling water for 10 minutes. Let cool before use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold water sterilising:</strong> Use sterilising tablets or solution. Follow instructions carefully.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>After Sterilising</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash your hands before handling sterilised equipment</li>
                    <li>Assemble bottles on a clean surface</li>
                    <li>Use immediately or store assembled in the fridge</li>
                    <li>Re-sterilise if not used within 24 hours</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Winding and Burping</h2>
                <p>Babies swallow air during feeds, which can cause discomfort. Burping helps release this air.</p>

                <h3>When to Burp</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Halfway through a bottle feed</li>
                    <li>After a feed</li>
                    <li>If your baby seems uncomfortable during a feed</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Burping Techniques</h3>
                <p><strong>Over the shoulder:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hold your baby upright against your shoulder</li>
                    <li>Support their head and neck</li>
                    <li>Gently pat or rub their back</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Sitting up:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sit your baby on your lap, leaning slightly forward</li>
                    <li>Support their chest and chin with one hand</li>
                    <li>Gently pat or rub their back with the other</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Face down on your lap:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lay your baby face down across your lap</li>
                    <li>Support their head (higher than their chest)</li>
                    <li>Gently pat or rub their back</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If they don't burp after a few minutes, they might not need to. Don't force it.</p>

                <h2>Combination Feeding</h2>
                <p>Many families combine breastfeeding and bottle feeding. This can work well, but:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduce bottles gradually (usually after breastfeeding is established, around 4-6 weeks)</li>
                    <li>Use paced bottle feeding to mimic breastfeeding pace</li>
                    <li>Your partner may need to express to maintain supply if skipping feeds</li>
                    <li>Talk to a health visitor or breastfeeding counsellor for guidance</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Feeding Challenges</h2>
                <h3>Baby Refusing the Bottle</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try different teats or bottle types</li>
                    <li>Have someone else offer the bottle (babies can smell breast milk)</li>
                    <li>Try when baby is calm but hungry</li>
                    <li>Experiment with temperature</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Baby Seems Constantly Hungry</h3>
                <p>In growth spurts (around 2-3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months), babies feed more frequently. This is normal and temporary. Feed on demand.</p>

                <h3>Spitting Up</h3>
                <p>Some spitting up after feeds is normal. If it's excessive or your baby seems in distress, see the <a href="health.html">Health</a> section.</p>
