                    <p>All babies develop at different rates. There's a wide range of what's normal. These milestones are guidelines, not strict rules. Your baby may reach some milestones earlier and others later - that's completely normal. Premature babies may reach milestones later (based on their corrected age).</p>
                    <p>If you're concerned about your baby's development, speak to your health visitor or GP. Trust your instincts.</p>

                <h2>How to Support Development</h2>
                <h3>Tummy Time</h3>
                <p>From birth, give your baby supervised tummy time every day. Start with a few minutes and build up. This helps develop neck, back, and shoulder strength needed for rolling, sitting, and crawling.</p>
                <p>Make it fun - get down on the floor with them, use toys, mirrors, or just your face.</p>

                <h3>Talk to Your Baby</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Narrate what you're doing</li>
                    <li>Describe what they're looking at</li>
                    <li>Use simple, clear language</li>
                    <li>Respond to their sounds and coos</li>
                    <li>Sing songs and nursery rhymes</li>
                    <li>Read books together (even from birth)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You're not just talking - you're teaching language, building connection, and supporting brain development.</p>

                <h3>Eye Contact and Interaction</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make eye contact when talking to them</li>
                    <li>Copy their facial expressions</li>
                    <li>Play peek-a-boo</li>
                    <li>Respond to their cues</li>
                    <li>Show them your face and expressions</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Books</h3>
                <p>Reading to your baby from birth supports language development, bonding, and creates positive associations with books. Don't worry if they don't seem interested at first - keep trying. Board books with simple pictures are great for babies.</p>

                <h3>Songs and Music</h3>
                <p>Singing helps with language development, rhythm, and bonding. Sing nursery rhymes, make up songs, or just sing along to music. Your baby doesn't care if you can't sing - they just love your voice.</p>

                <h3>Play</h3>
                <p>Play is how babies learn. Simple play ideas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rattles and soft toys</li>
                    <li>Mirrors (baby-safe)</li>
                    <li>Textured objects</li>
                    <li>Stacking cups or blocks</li>
                    <li>Peek-a-boo</li>
                    <li>Simple cause-and-effect toys</li>
                    <li>You don't need expensive toys - everyday objects work too</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Respond to Cues</h3>
                <p>When your baby shows interest in something, engage with it. When they look at something, talk about it. When they reach for something, help them explore it (safely). Responding to their interests supports their natural curiosity and learning.</p>

                <h2>Screen Time Guidance</h2>
                <div class="callout">
                    <h3>No Screen Time Under 18 Months</h3>
                    <p>The NHS and WHO recommend no screen time for babies under 18 months (except video calls with family). For 18-24 months, if you choose to introduce screens, watch together and choose high-quality, educational content. Limit to less than 1 hour per day.</p>
                    <p>Babies learn best through real-world interaction, not screens. Face-to-face interaction, talking, reading, and play are far more valuable for development.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>When to Seek Help</h2>
                <p>Speak to your health visitor or GP if you notice:</p>

                    <h3>Trust Your Instincts</h3>
                    <p>If you're concerned about your baby's development, don't wait. Speak to your health visitor or GP. Early intervention can make a big difference. It's always better to ask and be reassured than to wait and worry.</p>
