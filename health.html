                <h2>Taking Temperature</h2>
                <h3>Normal Temperature</h3>
                <p>A normal temperature for a baby is around 36.4°C (97.5°F). A fever is usually 38°C (100.4°F) or higher.</p>

                <h3>How to Take Temperature</h3>
                <p><strong>Under 4 weeks:</strong> Use a digital thermometer under the armpit. Hold it in place for the time specified in the instructions.</p>
                <p><strong>Over 4 weeks:</strong> You can use:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Digital thermometer under the armpit</li>
                    <li>Ear thermometer (follow instructions carefully)</li>
                    <li>Forehead thermometer (less accurate but easier)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Don't use a mercury thermometer. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

                <h3>What to Do with a Fever</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep them hydrated (offer feeds more frequently)</li>
                    <li>Dress them in light clothing</li>
                    <li>Don't over-bundle them</li>
                    <li>You can give infant paracetamol or ibuprofen (check dosage with pharmacist or GP)</li>
                    <li>Monitor them closely</li>
                    <li>Seek medical advice if concerned</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Health Issues</h2>
                <h3>Jaundice</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Yellowing of the skin and eyes, common in newborns.</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Yellow skin and eyes, usually appears 2-3 days after birth.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Usually harmless and clears on its own. Feed frequently (helps clear bilirubin). If severe or persists, see your GP or health visitor. In hospital, they may use phototherapy.</p>

                <h3>Nappy Rash</h3>
                <p>See the <a href="nappy-changing.html">Nappy Changing</a> section for details. Usually clears with frequent changes, barrier cream, and nappy-free time. See GP if severe, bleeding, or doesn't improve.</p>

                <h3>Sticky Eye</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Blocked tear duct causing sticky, crusty eyes.</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Sticky discharge, especially after sleep. Eye may be watery.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Clean with cooled boiled water and cotton wool (wipe from inner corner outward, use a fresh piece for each wipe). Usually clears by 12 months. See GP if eye is red, swollen, or has yellow/green discharge.</p>

                <h3>Cradle Cap</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Crusty, scaly patches on the scalp.</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Yellow or white scales on the scalp, sometimes on eyebrows.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Usually harmless and clears on its own. You can gently massage baby oil into the scalp, leave for a few hours, then gently brush with a soft brush. Don't pick at it. See GP if it spreads or becomes infected.</p>

                <h3>Baby Acne</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Small red or white bumps on the face, usually on cheeks and nose.</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Appears around 2-4 weeks, can look like teenage acne.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Usually clears on its own by 3-4 months. Don't use acne treatments. Just keep the face clean with water. Don't squeeze or scrub.</p>

                <h3>Colds</h3>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Runny or blocked nose, sneezing, mild cough, sometimes a slight temperature.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Most colds clear on their own. Keep them comfortable: use saline drops for blocked nose, keep them hydrated, use a humidifier. See GP if they're under 3 months, have a high temperature, or seem very unwell.</p>

                <h3>Cough</h3>
                <p>Most coughs are caused by colds and clear on their own. See GP if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cough lasts more than 3 weeks</li>
                    <li>They have difficulty breathing</li>
                    <li>Cough is severe or sounds unusual</li>
                    <li>They're under 3 months</li>
                    <li>They have a high temperature</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Keep them upright after feeds, burp regularly, feed smaller amounts more frequently. Most babies grow out of it. See GP if they're not gaining weight, seem in pain, or bring up large amounts frequently.</p>

                <h3>Teething</h3>
                <p><strong>When:</strong> Usually starts around 6 months, but can be earlier or later.</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Drooling, chewing on things, irritability, red cheeks, sometimes a slight temperature.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Give them something safe to chew (teething ring, clean finger). You can gently rub their gums. Infant paracetamol can help if they're in pain (check dosage). See GP if they have a high temperature or seem very unwell (teething doesn't cause high fevers).</p>

                <h3>Constipation</h3>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Hard, dry poo, difficulty passing poo, less frequent poos than usual, tummy pain.</p>
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> For breastfed babies, constipation is rare. For formula-fed, check you're making formula correctly. Offer extra water (if over 6 months). Gentle tummy massage. See GP if it persists or your baby seems in distress.</p>

                <h3>Diarrhea</h3>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Frequent, watery poos.</p>

                <h2>Routine Check-ups and Vaccinations</h2>
                <h3>Newborn Check</h3>
                <p>Within 72 hours of birth, your baby will have a physical examination checking heart, hips, eyes, and testes (for boys).</p>

                <h3>6-8 Week Check</h3>
                <p>Your GP will check your baby's development, do another physical examination, and discuss vaccinations.</p>

                <h3>Health Visitor Visits</h3>
                <p>Your health visitor will visit you at home and at clinics. They check your baby's weight, development, and offer support and advice.</p>

                <h3>Vaccinations</h3>
                <p>Your baby will be offered vaccinations at 8, 12, and 16 weeks, then at 12 months. These protect against serious diseases. Speak to your GP or health visitor if you have questions about vaccinations.</p>

                <h2>Signs of Dehydration</h2>
                <p>Watch for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fewer wet nappies than usual</li>
                    <li>Dark yellow urine</li>
                    <li>Dry mouth and lips</li>
                    <li>Sunken fontanelle (soft spot)</li>
                    <li>No tears when crying</li>
                    <li>Drowsiness or irritability</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you see signs of dehydration, seek medical help urgently.</p>

                <h2>Trust Your Instincts</h2>
                <p>You know your baby best. If something doesn't feel right, even if you can't put your finger on it, trust your instincts and seek help. Healthcare professionals would rather you call with a false alarm than miss something serious.</p>

                <h2>Preparing for Appointments</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Write down questions beforehand</li>
                    <li>Note symptoms, when they started, and any changes</li>
                    <li>Bring your baby's red book (health record)</li>
                    <li>Don't be afraid to ask questions</li>
                    <li>If you don't understand something, ask for clarification</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Emergency Kit</h2>
                <p>Keep at home:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Digital thermometer</li>
                    <li>Infant paracetamol (check dosage with pharmacist)</li>
                    <li>Infant ibuprofen (check dosage with pharmacist)</li>
                    <li>Saline drops for blocked nose</li>
                    <li>First aid kit</li>
                    <li>Emergency numbers (999, 111, GP, health visitor)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="callout">
                    <h3>Remember</h3>
                    <p>Most health issues in babies are minor and clear on their own. But when in doubt, ask. It's always better to be safe. You're not bothering anyone by asking for help - that's what healthcare professionals are there for.</p>
