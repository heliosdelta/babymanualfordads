                <h1>Soothing Crying</h1>
                <p class="lede">Crying is how babies communicate. Understanding why they cry and how to soothe them will help you both.</p>

                <h2>Why Babies Cry</h2>
                <p>Babies cry for many reasons. Here are the most common, in order of likelihood:</p>

                <h3>1. Hungry</h3>
                <p>This is the most common reason. Look for hunger cues: rooting, sucking on hands, bringing hands to mouth. Feed on demand - newborns need to feed frequently.</p>

                <h3>2. Tired</h3>
                <p>Babies can get overtired, which makes them harder to settle. Look for tired cues: yawning, rubbing eyes, looking away, becoming fussy. Put them down for a nap before they get too tired.</p>

                <h3>3. Dirty Nappy</h3>
                <p>Some babies are very sensitive to a wet or dirty nappy. Check and change if needed.</p>

                <h3>4. Temperature</h3>
                <p>Too hot or too cold. Check by feeling their chest or back (not hands or feet). Dress them in one more layer than you're wearing.</p>

                <h3>5. Needs Comfort</h3>
                <p>Sometimes babies just need to be held, cuddled, or close to you. This is normal and healthy.</p>

                <h3>6. Overstimulated</h3>
                <p>Too much noise, light, or activity can overwhelm babies. Take them to a quiet, dim room and hold them close.</p>

                <h3>7. Wind</h3>
                <p>Trapped wind can cause discomfort. Try burping, gentle tummy massage, or bicycle legs.</p>

                <h3>8. Unwell</h3>
                <p>If your baby's cry sounds different (high-pitched, weak, or continuous), or they have other symptoms, they might be unwell. See the <a href="health.html">Health</a> section for when to seek help.</p>

                <h2>Soothing Techniques</h2>
                <h3>The 5 S's (Dr. Harvey Karp)</h3>
                <p>These techniques mimic the womb environment and can be very effective:</p>

                <h4>1. Swaddle</h4>
                <p>Wrap your baby snugly in a lightweight blanket. This recreates the feeling of being in the womb. Make sure it's not too tight and they can still move their hips.</p>

                <h4>2. Side or Stomach Position</h4>
                <p>Hold your baby on their side or stomach (in your arms, not in their cot). This can help calm them. <strong>Important:</strong> Always place them on their back to sleep.</p>

                <h4>3. Shush</h4>
                <p>Make a loud "shushing" sound near their ear, or use white noise. The volume should match their crying - loud enough to be heard over it. This mimics the sounds they heard in the womb.</p>

                <h4>4. Swing</h4>
                <p>Gentle, rhythmic motion. Rock them, bounce gently, or walk while holding them. Keep movements small and controlled. Some babies like a gentle jiggle, others prefer smooth rocking.</p>

                <h4>5. Suck</h4>
                <p>Offer a dummy/pacifier, or let them suck on your (clean) finger. Sucking is very calming for babies.</p>

                <p>Try all 5 together for maximum effect. Once they're calm, you can gradually reduce the intensity.</p>

                <h3>Other Effective Techniques</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Many babies calm when walked around</li>
                    <li><strong>Car ride:</strong> The motion of a car can be very soothing (but don't drive when you're exhausted)</li>
                    <li><strong>Baby carrier:</strong> Being close to you and the motion can help</li>
                    <li><strong>Warm bath:</strong> Some babies find water calming</li>
                    <li><strong>Singing or humming:</strong> Your voice is familiar and comforting</li>
                    <li><strong>Gentle massage:</strong> Light strokes on their back or tummy</li>
                    <li><strong>Fresh air:</strong> Sometimes a change of scene helps</li>
                    <li><strong>Dim lights:</strong> Reduce stimulation</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Holding Positions for Fussy Babies</h2>
                <h3>Football Hold</h3>
                <p>Hold your baby face down along your forearm, with their head in your hand and their body along your arm. Your other hand supports their body. This can help with wind and is very calming.</p>

                <h3>Upright on Shoulder</h3>
                <p>Hold your baby upright against your shoulder, supporting their head and neck. Gently pat or rub their back. Good for burping and comfort.</p>

                <h3>Colic Hold</h3>
                <p>Lay your baby face down across your lap, supporting their head (higher than their body). Gently pat or rub their back. This position can help with wind.</p>

                <h2>Colic</h2>
                <h3>What is Colic?</h3>
                <p>Colic is defined as excessive crying in an otherwise healthy baby. It usually:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Starts around 2-3 weeks</li>
                    <li>Peaks around 6 weeks</li>
                    <li>Usually improves by 3-4 months</li>
                    <li>Happens at the same time each day (often evening)</li>
                    <li>Involves intense, inconsolable crying</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Signs of Colic</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crying for more than 3 hours a day, 3 days a week, for 3 weeks</li>
                    <li>Crying that starts and stops suddenly</li>
                    <li>Baby draws legs up, clenches fists, arches back</li>
                    <li>Difficult to soothe</li>
                    <li>Baby is otherwise healthy and feeding well</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What Helps with Colic</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try the 5 S's</li>
                    <li>Gentle tummy massage (clockwise)</li>
                    <li>Bicycle legs (gently move their legs in a cycling motion)</li>
                    <li>Warm bath</li>
                    <li>White noise or shushing</li>
                    <li>Baby carrier or sling</li>
                    <li>If bottle feeding, try different teats or check for wind</li>
                    <li>If breastfeeding, your partner might want to check their diet (some foods can affect babies)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you suspect colic, still see your GP or health visitor to rule out other causes.</p>

                <h2>When You're at Breaking Point</h2>
                <div class="warning-callout">
                    <h3>Never Shake a Baby</h3>
                    <p>Shaking a baby can cause serious brain damage or death. If you feel like you might lose control:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Put your baby down safely in their cot</li>
                        <li>Leave the room</li>
                        <li>Take a break - even 5 minutes can help</li>
                        <li>Call someone for help</li>
                        <li>Never pick them up again until you're calm</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>It's okay to let your baby cry safely in their cot while you take a break. A few minutes of crying is better than the risk of shaking.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Take Breaks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tag in your partner</li>
                    <li>Ask family or friends for help</li>
                    <li>Put your baby down safely and step away</li>
                    <li>Call a helpline (see <a href="support.html">Getting Support</a>)</li>
                    <li>Remember: this phase will pass</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Purple Crying Framework</h2>
                <p>The Period of PURPLE Crying describes a normal developmental phase:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>P</strong>eak of crying (around 2 months)</li>
                    <li><strong>U</strong>nexpected (can start and stop for no reason)</li>
                    <li><strong>R</strong>esists soothing (sometimes nothing works)</li>
                    <li><strong>P</strong>ain-like face (but they're not in pain)</li>
                    <li><strong>L</strong>ong lasting (can go on for hours)</li>
                    <li><strong>E</strong>vening (often worse in the evening)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is a normal phase that all babies go through. It's not your fault, and it's not because you're doing something wrong. It will pass.</p>

                <h2>When Crying is a Concern</h2>
                <p>See a healthcare professional if your baby's crying:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sounds different (high-pitched, weak, or moaning)</li>
                    <li>Is accompanied by a fever</li>
                    <li>Is accompanied by vomiting or diarrhea</li>
                    <li>Is accompanied by a rash</li>
                    <li>Your baby is difficult to wake or very lethargic</li>
                    <li>Your baby isn't feeding</li>
                    <li>You're worried for any reason</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Tips for Managing Crying</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remember: crying is communication, not manipulation</li>
                    <li>You can't spoil a baby by responding to their needs</li>
                    <li>Try different techniques - what works one day might not work the next</li>
                    <li>Some crying is normal - babies cry 1-3 hours per day on average</li>
                    <li>Trust your instincts - if something feels wrong, get help</li>
                    <li>Look after yourself - you can't help your baby if you're at breaking point</li>
                    <li>This phase is temporary - it will get better</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="callout">
                    <h3>Remember</h3>
                    <p>You're not failing if your baby cries and you can't immediately soothe them. Sometimes babies just need to cry. As long as you've checked their basic needs and they're safe, it's okay. You're doing your best, and that's enough.</p>
