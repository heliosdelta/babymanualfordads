                <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                <p class="lede">The first 48 hours can feel overwhelming. Here's what you need to know and do in those crucial early days.</p>

                <h2>The First 48 Hours</h2>
                <p>Those first two days are intense. Your partner has just given birth, and you're both exhausted. Your baby is learning to feed, sleep, and exist outside the womb. Here's what matters most:</p>

                <h3>Skin-to-Skin Contact</h3>
                <p>Skin-to-skin contact isn't just for mums. Dads can and should do it too. It helps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regulate your baby's temperature and heart rate</li>
                    <li>Build a strong bond between you and your baby</li>
                    <li>Calm both you and your baby</li>
                    <li>Support breastfeeding if your partner is doing it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>How to do it: Take your shirt off, hold your baby (wearing just a nappy) against your chest, and cover you both with a blanket. Do this for at least an hour a day in those first weeks.</p>

                <h3>Supporting Feeding</h3>
                <p>If your partner is breastfeeding, your role is crucial:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring water and snacks during feeds</li>
                    <li>Help position pillows for comfort</li>
                    <li>Take the baby for burping after feeds</li>
                    <li>Change nappies so your partner can rest</li>
                    <li>Be patient - breastfeeding can be challenging at first</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you're bottle feeding from the start, see the <a href="feeding.html">Feeding</a> section for detailed guidance.</p>

                <h3>Learning Your Baby's Cues</h3>
                <p>Babies communicate through cues. In the first days, you'll start recognising:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hunger:</strong> Rooting (turning head, opening mouth), sucking on hands, crying (late sign)</li>
                    <li><strong>Tired:</strong> Yawning, rubbing eyes, looking away, becoming fussy</li>
                    <li><strong>Needs changing:</strong> Fussing, squirming</li>
                    <li><strong>Overstimulated:</strong> Looking away, arching back, crying</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Responding early to these cues makes everything easier.</p>

                <h3>Changing Nappies - The Basics</h3>
                <p>You'll be doing this a lot. In the first 48 hours, expect meconium - a dark, sticky, tar-like poo. This is normal. See the <a href="nappy-changing.html">Nappy Changing</a> section for the full step-by-step guide.</p>
                <p>Key points for now:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always have everything ready before you start</li>
                    <li>Never leave your baby unattended on a changing surface</li>
                    <li>Clean front to back for girls</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands before and after</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Your Role as a Dad</h2>
                <p>You're not just a helper - you're a parent. Your involvement matters from day one.</p>

                <h3>What You Can Do</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bond with your baby:</strong> Hold them, talk to them, do skin-to-skin</li>
                    <li><strong>Share the load:</strong> Change nappies, do feeds (if bottle feeding), settle them</li>
                    <li><strong>Support your partner:</strong> Practical help and emotional support are both essential</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn together:</strong> Attend appointments, ask questions, read up</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust your instincts:</strong> You know your baby too</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>It's Normal to Feel</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overwhelmed</li>
                    <li>Uncertain about what to do</li>
                    <li>Exhausted</li>
                    <li>Like you're not doing enough</li>
                    <li>Joyful and terrified at the same time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of this is normal. You're learning, and that's okay.</p>

                <h2>When to Get Help</h2>
                <p>Don't hesitate to ask for help. In the first 48 hours, contact a healthcare professional if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your baby isn't feeding at all</li>
                    <li>Your baby is very sleepy and hard to wake for feeds</li>
                    <li>Your baby's breathing seems unusual (fast, laboured, or noisy)</li>
                    <li>Your baby has a temperature</li>
                    <li>Your baby is very jaundiced (yellow skin)</li>
                    <li>You're worried about anything</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-callout">
                    <h3>Trust Your Instincts</h3>
                    <p>If something doesn't feel right, it's always better to ask. Healthcare professionals would rather you call with a false alarm than miss something serious.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Essential Skills to Learn</h2>
                <p>In the first week, focus on mastering these basics:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Holding your baby safely</strong> - Always support the head and neck</li>
                    <li><strong>Changing a nappy</strong> - See <a href="nappy-changing.html">Nappy Changing</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Feeding</strong> - See <a href="feeding.html">Feeding</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Burping/winding</strong> - See <a href="feeding.html">Feeding</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Recognising hunger and tired cues</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Safe sleep setup</strong> - See <a href="sleep.html">Sleep</a></li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Looking After Yourself</h2>
                <p>You can't pour from an empty cup. In those first days:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sleep when you can (even if it's just 20 minutes)</li>
                    <li>Eat regular meals</li>
                    <li>Stay hydrated</li>
                    <li>Accept help from family and friends</li>
                    <li>Talk about how you're feeling</li>
                </ul>
