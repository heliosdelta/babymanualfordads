                <h1>Bathing</h1>
                <p class="lede">Bathing your baby doesn't need to be stressful. Here's how to do it safely and confidently.</p>

                <h2>How Often to Bath</h2>
                <p>Newborns don't need a full bath every day. 2-3 times per week is plenty. Too much bathing can dry out their delicate skin.</p>
                <p>In between baths, do a "top and tail" wash (see below) to keep face, hands, and nappy area clean.</p>
                <p>As they get older and start eating solids and crawling, you may want to bath them more frequently.</p>

                <h2>Before You Start</h2>
                <h3>What You Need</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Baby bath or clean sink/basin</li>
                    <li>Warm water (test with your elbow or wrist - should feel warm, not hot)</li>
                    <li>Soft towels (at least 2)</li>
                    <li>Cotton wool or soft cloths</li>
                    <li>Mild baby soap or cleanser (optional - water is often enough)</li>
                    <li>Clean nappy and clothes</li>
                    <li>Room should be warm (no drafts)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fill the bath with warm water (about 37°C or body temperature)</li>
                    <li>Have everything within reach before you start</li>
                    <li>Never leave your baby unattended - not even for a second</li>
                    <li>Keep one hand on your baby at all times</li>
                    <li>Test water temperature with your elbow or wrist</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-callout">
                    <h3>Water Temperature Safety</h3>
                    <p>Always test water temperature before putting your baby in. It should feel warm, not hot. Hot water can scald a baby's delicate skin in seconds. Never add hot water while your baby is in the bath.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Top-and-Tail Wash</h2>
                <p>This is a quick clean for between full baths. You'll do this more often than full baths in the early weeks.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lay your baby on a towel or changing mat</li>
                    <li>Keep them covered with a towel, only exposing the part you're washing</li>
                    <li>Use cotton wool or a soft cloth dipped in warm water</li>
                    <li><strong>Top:</strong> Clean face (no soap needed), then hands</li>
                    <li><strong>Tail:</strong> Clean nappy area (front to back for girls)</li>
                    <li>Pat dry with a soft towel</li>
                    <li>Dress and nappy as normal</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Full Bath Process</h2>
                <h3>Step-by-Step</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Undress your baby, keeping their nappy on for now</li>
                    <li>Wrap them in a towel</li>
                    <li>Hold them securely and gently lower them into the water feet first</li>
                    <li>Keep one hand supporting their head and neck at all times</li>
                    <li>Use your free hand to splash water over their body to keep them warm</li>
                    <li>Remove the nappy once they're in the water</li>
                    <li>Use a soft cloth or your hand to gently wash them</li>
                    <li>If using soap, use a small amount of mild baby soap</li>
                    <li>Wash from top to bottom</li>
                    <li>For girls: clean genitals front to back</li>
                    <li>For boys: clean around genitals (don't retract foreskin if uncircumcised)</li>
                    <li>Keep the bath to 5-10 minutes to avoid them getting cold</li>
                    <li>Lift them out carefully, supporting head and neck</li>
                    <li>Wrap immediately in a warm, dry towel</li>
                    <li>Pat dry (don't rub), paying attention to creases</li>
                    <li>Dress and nappy quickly to keep them warm</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Holding Techniques</h2>
                <h3>For Newborns</h3>
                <p>Support their head and neck with one hand (your forearm under their head, your hand holding their shoulder). Your other hand supports their bottom. Lower them into the water slowly.</p>

                <h3>For Older Babies</h3>
                <p>Once they can sit up (around 6 months), you can support them in a sitting position. Always keep one hand on them for safety.</p>

                <h2>Common Concerns</h2>
                <h3>Baby Cries During Bath</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check water temperature - might be too hot or cold</li>
                    <li>Make sure the room is warm enough</li>
                    <li>Try talking or singing to them</li>
                    <li>Keep it quick - they might just not like it yet</li>
                    <li>Some babies prefer showers (held securely) to baths</li>
                    <li>Try bathing together (see below)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Umbilical Cord Stump</h3>
                <p>Until the cord stump falls off (usually 1-2 weeks), stick to top-and-tail washes. Keep the stump dry. Once it's healed, you can do full baths.</p>

                <h3>Dry Skin</h3>
                <p>If your baby has dry skin:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bath less frequently</li>
                    <li>Use less or no soap</li>
                    <li>Keep baths short</li>
                    <li>Pat dry and apply a gentle moisturiser</li>
                    <li>If concerned, speak to your health visitor or GP</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Moving to the Big Bath</h2>
                <p>Once your baby can sit up unaided (around 6 months), you can move to the big bath. Use a non-slip mat and never leave them unattended. Keep the water shallow (just enough to cover their legs when sitting).</p>
                <p>Always test the water temperature first. Run cold water last to cool the taps.</p>

                <h2>Bathing Together</h2>
                <p>Bathing with your baby can be a lovely bonding experience, but follow these safety rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have someone else hand your baby to you once you're in</li>
                    <li>Have someone else take your baby out when you're done</li>
                    <li>Keep water temperature lower than you'd normally have it</li>
                    <li>Keep your baby's head well above water at all times</li>
                    <li>Support them securely - they can be slippery when wet</li>
                    <li>Keep it short - 5-10 minutes</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Products: What You Need vs Don't Need</h2>
                <h3>Essential</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Warm water</li>
                    <li>Soft towels</li>
                    <li>Cotton wool or soft cloths</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Nice to Have</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mild baby soap or cleanser (fragrance-free is best)</li>
                    <li>Baby bath thermometer (though your elbow works fine)</li>
                    <li>Baby bath support (for newborns)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Don't Need</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bubble bath (can irritate skin and genitals)</li>
                    <li>Adult soap or shampoo</li>
                    <li>Lots of products - simple is best</li>
                    <li>Bath toys (until they're older and can sit up)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>After the Bath</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dry thoroughly, especially in creases (neck, armpits, groin)</li>
                    <li>Apply moisturiser if needed (especially for dry skin)</li>
                    <li>Dress in clean clothes</li>
                    <li>Some babies are sleepy after a bath - great for bedtime routine</li>
                    <li>Others are alert - that's fine too</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep it quick - 5-10 minutes is plenty</li>
                    <li>Stay calm - babies pick up on stress</li>
                    <li>Make it fun - sing, talk, make it a positive experience</li>
                    <li>Have everything ready before you start</li>
                    <li>Never leave your baby unattended, even for a second</li>
                    <li>If you're unsure or nervous, ask your partner or health visitor to show you</li>
                    <li>Practice makes it easier</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Remember</h3>
                    <p>Bathing doesn't have to be perfect. As long as your baby is safe, warm, and reasonably clean, you're doing it right. They don't need to be spotless every day.</p>
