                <h1>Nappy Changing</h1>
                <p class="lede">You'll be changing a lot of nappies. Here's how to do it efficiently and what you'll encounter along the way.</p>

                <h2>What You Need</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean nappy</li>
                    <li>Nappy wipes or cotton wool and warm water</li>
                    <li>Barrier cream (if needed)</li>
                    <li>Nappy bag or bin</li>
                    <li>Clean clothes (just in case)</li>
                    <li>Changing mat or towel</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The 16-Step Process</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash your hands</li>
                    <li>Get everything ready before you start</li>
                    <li>Lay your baby on a safe, flat surface (never leave them unattended)</li>
                    <li>Undo the nappy tabs</li>
                    <li>Lift your baby's legs gently by the ankles</li>
                    <li>Use the front of the dirty nappy to wipe away most of the mess</li>
                    <li>Fold the dirty nappy under your baby (clean side up)</li>
                    <li>Clean your baby's bottom thoroughly</li>
                    <li>For girls: wipe front to back to avoid infection</li>
                    <li>For boys: clean around genitals, and if uncircumcised, don't retract the foreskin</li>
                    <li>Make sure all creases are clean and dry</li>
                    <li>Apply barrier cream if needed (especially for nappy rash)</li>
                    <li>Slide the clean nappy under your baby</li>
                    <li>Bring the front up between the legs</li>
                    <li>Fasten the tabs securely (not too tight - you should fit two fingers)</li>
                    <li>Dispose of the dirty nappy, wash your hands</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="warning-callout">
                    <h3>Safety First</h3>
                    <p>Never leave your baby unattended on a changing surface, even for a second. Keep one hand on them at all times. If you need to answer the door or phone, take your baby with you.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What You'll Encounter</h2>
                <h3>Meconium (First 24-48 Hours)</h3>
                <p>Dark, sticky, tar-like poo. This is normal - it's what was in your baby's intestines before birth. It can be tricky to clean. Use plenty of wipes or cotton wool with warm water.</p>

                <h3>Breastfed Baby Poo</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yellow, mustard-like consistency</li>
                    <li>Can be runny or seedy</li>
                    <li>Usually doesn't smell bad</li>
                    <li>Frequency varies - some babies poo after every feed, others once a week (both normal)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Formula-Fed Baby Poo</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Paler yellow or brown</li>
                    <li>Thicker consistency</li>
                    <li>Stronger smell</li>
                    <li>Usually more regular (once or twice a day)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>As They Get Older</h3>
                <p>When you introduce solid foods (around 6 months), poo changes again - becomes more formed, darker, and smellier. This is normal.</p>

                <h2>How Often to Change</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Newborns:</strong> After every feed (8-12 times a day)</li>
                    <li><strong>Older babies:</strong> Every 2-3 hours, or whenever wet/dirty</li>
                    <li><strong>Always change:</strong> Before sleep, after poo, if nappy feels heavy</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Check nappies regularly. Wet nappies should feel heavy but not soaked. Change poo nappies immediately to prevent nappy rash.</p>

                <h2>Common Challenges</h2>
                <h3>The Wiggler</h3>
                <p>Some babies never stop moving. Strategies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give them something to hold (clean nappy, small toy)</li>
                    <li>Sing or talk to them</li>
                    <li>Change on the floor (safer if they roll)</li>
                    <li>Work quickly but safely</li>
                    <li>As they get older, explain what you're doing</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Explosion</h3>
                <p>Sometimes poo escapes the nappy. It happens. Have clean clothes ready. If it's really bad, a quick bath might be easier than trying to wipe everything.</p>

                <h3>Mid-Change Poo</h3>
                <p>Babies often poo during or right after a change. Keep the clean nappy ready but don't put it on until you're sure they're done. You might need to wait a minute or two.</p>

                <h3>The Fussy Baby</h3>
                <p>If your baby cries during changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure the surface isn't too cold</li>
                    <li>Talk or sing to them</li>
                    <li>Work quickly but gently</li>
                    <li>Check for nappy rash (might be painful)</li>
                    <li>Try changing in a different location</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Nappy Rash</h2>
                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change nappies frequently</li>
                    <li>Clean thoroughly and dry completely</li>
                    <li>Use barrier cream if your baby is prone to rash</li>
                    <li>Let your baby have nappy-free time (on a towel)</li>
                    <li>Avoid wipes with alcohol or fragrances if skin is sensitive</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change nappies more frequently</li>
                    <li>Clean with warm water and cotton wool instead of wipes</li>
                    <li>Pat dry (don't rub)</li>
                    <li>Apply a thick layer of barrier cream</li>
                    <li>Increase nappy-free time</li>
                    <li>If it doesn't improve in a few days, see your GP or health visitor</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-callout">
                    <h3>When to Seek Help</h3>
                    <p>See a healthcare professional if nappy rash is severe, bleeding, has blisters, or doesn't improve with treatment. It might be a fungal infection requiring medication.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Disposable vs Reusable</h2>
                <h3>Disposable Nappies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Convenient and quick</li>
                    <li>More expensive long-term</li>
                    <li>More waste</li>
                    <li>Good for overnight (more absorbent)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Reusable Nappies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>More cost-effective long-term</li>
                    <li>Better for the environment</li>
                    <li>Require washing and preparation</li>
                    <li>Many modern designs are easy to use</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Many families use a combination. There's no right or wrong choice - do what works for your family.</p>
