                <h3>Your Partner</h3>

                    <p>Being a dad is one of the hardest and most rewarding things you'll ever do. You don't have to be perfect. You just have to be present, try your best, and ask for help when you need it.</p>
                    <p>You're learning, your baby is learning, and you're figuring it out together. That's enough. You're enough.</p>
