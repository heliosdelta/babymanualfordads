                <h1>Sleep</h1>
                <p class="lede">Understanding safe sleep, what's normal, and how to help your baby (and you) get more rest.</p>

                <div class="warning-callout">
                    <h3>Safe Sleep is Critical</h3>
                    <p>Following safe sleep guidelines significantly reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). These rules are not optional - they're essential for your baby's safety.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Safe Sleep Rules</h2>
                <h3>1. Back to Sleep</h3>
                <p>Always place your baby on their back to sleep, for every sleep (naps and nighttime). Once they can roll over themselves (usually around 4-6 months), you don't need to keep turning them back, but always start them on their back.</p>

                <h3>2. Feet to Foot</h3>
                <p>Place your baby with their feet at the foot of the cot. This prevents them from wriggling under the covers.</p>

                <h3>3. Clear Cot</h3>
                <p>Your baby's sleep space should be clear of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pillows</li>
                    <li>Duvets or heavy blankets</li>
                    <li>Soft toys</li>
                    <li>Bumpers</li>
                    <li>Loose bedding</li>
                    <li>Sleep positioners or nests</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Use a firm, flat mattress with a fitted sheet. That's it.</p>

                <h3>4. Temperature</h3>
                <p>Room temperature should be 16-20°C (61-68°F). Use a room thermometer. Dress your baby in light layers - a vest, sleepsuit, and lightweight sleeping bag is usually enough. Don't overheat them.</p>
                <p>Check if they're too hot by feeling their chest or back - hands and feet can feel cold even when they're warm enough.</p>

                <h3>5. Same Room</h3>
                <p>Your baby should sleep in the same room as you for at least the first 6 months, ideally 12 months. This reduces SIDS risk significantly.</p>

                <h3>6. No Smoking</h3>
                <p>Never smoke around your baby or in the house. Secondhand smoke increases SIDS risk.</p>

                <h3>7. Firm Mattress</h3>
                <p>Use a firm, flat mattress that fits the cot properly with no gaps. Don't use memory foam or soft mattresses.</p>

                <h2>What's Normal by Age</h2>
                <h3>0-3 Months</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sleep 14-17 hours per day (but in short chunks)</li>
                    <li>Wake every 2-4 hours for feeds</li>
                    <li>No real day/night distinction yet</li>
                    <li>Sleep cycles are 50-60 minutes</li>
                    <li>Very normal to wake frequently</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3-6 Months</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sleep 12-15 hours per day</li>
                    <li>May start sleeping longer stretches at night (4-6 hours)</li>
                    <li>Usually 3-4 naps per day</li>
                    <li>Day/night rhythm starting to develop</li>
                    <li>May start to self-settle</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6-12 Months</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sleep 12-14 hours per day</li>
                    <li>May sleep 6-8 hours at night</li>
                    <li>Usually 2-3 naps per day</li>
                    <li>More predictable sleep patterns</li>
                    <li>May wake due to teething, separation anxiety, or developmental leaps</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Every baby is different. These are averages, not rules. Some babies need more sleep, some less.</p>

                <h2>Safe Sleep Setup</h2>
                <h3>Cot or Moses Basket</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firm, flat mattress</li>
                    <li>Fitted sheet only</li>
                    <li>No pillows, toys, or loose bedding</li>
                    <li>Place in your room for first 6-12 months</li>
                    <li>Keep away from windows, radiators, and cords</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Sleeping Bags</h3>
                <p>Sleeping bags (with armholes, no hood) are safer than blankets because they can't be kicked off or pulled over the face. Choose the right tog for the room temperature and ensure it fits properly (not too loose around the neck).</p>

                <h2>Settling Techniques</h2>
                <h3>Swaddling (0-3 Months)</h3>
                <p>Some babies sleep better when swaddled. If you swaddle:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a lightweight, breathable blanket</li>
                    <li>Keep it snug but not tight</li>
                    <li>Leave room for hips to move</li>
                    <li>Stop once baby can roll over</li>
                    <li>Always place swaddled baby on their back</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>White Noise</h3>
                <p>White noise can help babies settle and stay asleep by masking other sounds. Use a white noise machine or app, but keep the volume low (no louder than a shower).</p>

                <h3>The 5 S's (Dr. Harvey Karp)</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Swaddle:</strong> Wrap snugly (if they like it)</li>
                    <li><strong>Side/Stomach:</strong> Hold on side or stomach (but always place in cot on back)</li>
                    <li><strong>Shush:</strong> Make shushing sounds or use white noise</li>
                    <li><strong>Swing:</strong> Gentle rhythmic motion (rocking, bouncing)</li>
                    <li><strong>Suck:</strong> Offer a dummy/pacifier or finger</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Bedtime Routine</h3>
                <p>From around 6-8 weeks, a consistent bedtime routine helps signal that it's time to sleep:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bath (or top and tail)</li>
                    <li>Change into sleep clothes</li>
                    <li>Feed</li>
                    <li>Story or song</li>
                    <li>Into cot while drowsy but awake</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Keep it simple and consistent. Do it in the same order every night.</p>

                <h2>Night Time Strategy</h2>
                <h3>Split Shifts</h3>
                <p>Many couples find split shifts work well:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One parent takes the first shift (e.g., 9pm-2am)</li>
                    <li>The other takes the second shift (e.g., 2am-7am)</li>
                    <li>Each gets a block of uninterrupted sleep</li>
                    <li>Adjust times based on your schedules</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tag Team Approach</h3>
                <p>Alternate who gets up, or have one person do feeds while the other does settling. Find what works for your family.</p>

                <h2>Common Sleep Problems</h2>
                <h3>Won't Settle</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check they're not hungry, wet, or uncomfortable</li>
                    <li>Try the 5 S's</li>
                    <li>Keep the room dark and quiet</li>
                    <li>Be patient - some babies take longer to settle</li>
                    <li>If you're getting frustrated, tag in your partner</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Wakes Frequently</h3>
                <p>This is normal, especially in the first few months. Babies have short sleep cycles and need to feed often. It will get better, but it takes time.</p>

                <h3>Won't Sleep in Cot</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try warming the mattress with a hot water bottle (remove before placing baby)</li>
                    <li>Put a worn t-shirt in the cot (your smell can be comforting)</li>
                    <li>Start with naps in the cot</li>
                    <li>Be consistent - keep trying</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Sleep Regression</h3>
                <p>Around 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months, many babies go through sleep regressions due to developmental changes. This is temporary. Stick to your routine and ride it out.</p>

                <h2>Co-Sleeping Safety</h2>
                <div class="warning-callout">
                    <h3>Important: Co-Sleeping Risks</h3>
                    <p>The safest place for your baby to sleep is in their own cot in your room. However, if you do co-sleep, follow these safety guidelines:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Never co-sleep if you or your partner smoke, have drunk alcohol, taken drugs, or are extremely tired</li>
                        <li>Never co-sleep on a sofa or armchair</li>
                        <li>Keep pillows and duvets away from your baby</li>
                        <li>Make sure your baby can't fall out of bed</li>
                        <li>Don't let pets sleep in the bed</li>
                        <li>Keep your baby on their back</li>
                        <li>Don't co-sleep if your baby was premature or had a low birth weight</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Consider a sidecar cot (attaches to your bed) as a safer alternative.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Dummies/Pacifiers</h2>
                <p>Dummies can help with settling and may reduce SIDS risk. If you use one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't force it - some babies don't like them</li>
                    <li>Use orthodontic dummies</li>
                    <li>Keep them clean</li>
                    <li>Don't attach cords or chains (strangulation risk)</li>
                    <li>Wean off by 12 months to avoid dental issues</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Tips for Better Sleep (For Everyone)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accept that frequent waking is normal in the early months</li>
                    <li>Sleep when your baby sleeps (easier said than done, but try)</li>
                    <li>Share the load with your partner</li>
                    <li>Lower your expectations - perfect sleep isn't realistic</li>
                    <li>Remember: this phase will pass</li>
                    <li>Ask for help if you're struggling</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="callout">
                    <h3>Remember</h3>
                    <p>Sleep deprivation is real and hard. It's okay to find it difficult. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to put your baby down safely in their cot and take a 5-minute break if you need to.</p>
